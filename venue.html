        <h1>ABOUT THE MET OFFICE</h1>
        <p>
        The Met Office is a global centre of excellence in weather and climate science, and

        the UK’s national weather service.
        </p>
        <p>
        Founded in 1854, the Met Office pioneered weather forecasting. Ever since then we

        have been at the forefront of developments in science and technology. Our

        reputation for scientific excellence has been built through the understanding of our

        scientists and our close links with international academia.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the UK’s national weather service, we generate forecasts 24 hours a day, 365

        days a year. Meanwhile our climate research plays a vital role in helping determine

        the worldwide response to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Met Office works closely with governments, individuals and organisations to

        share expert scientific knowledge and advice. Working in partnership with others we

        make sure people everywhere can access our forecasts across mobile, web and

        broadcast platforms.
