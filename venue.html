        <p>The Met Office is situated in Exeter, about 200 miles west of London. The closest airport is in Exeter, although you are more likely to find international flights to Bristol or London. There are bus links from Bristol and train links from London to Exeter.</p>

        <h1>WHERE TO STAY</h1>
        <p>We would recomment staying in the centre of Exeter, rather than next to the Met Office. There are far more restaurants and pubs in central Exeter, and you can easily commute to the venue. You can take several busses, with the 56 bus from the Central Bus station taking you directly to the Met Office door.</p>
        <h1>ABOUT THE MET OFFICE</h1>
        <p>
        The Met Office is a global centre of excellence in weather and climate science, and

        the UK’s national weather service.
        </p>
        <p>
        Founded in 1854, the Met Office pioneered weather forecasting. Ever since then we

        have been at the forefront of developments in science and technology. Our

        reputation for scientific excellence has been built through the understanding of our

        scientists and our close links with international academia.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the UK’s national weather service, we generate forecasts 24 hours a day, 365

        days a year. Meanwhile our climate research plays a vital role in helping determine

        the worldwide response to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Met Office works closely with governments, individuals and organisations to

        share expert scientific knowledge and advice. Working in partnership with others we

        make sure people everywhere can access our forecasts across mobile, web and

        broadcast platforms.
